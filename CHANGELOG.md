# Changelog

All notable changes to MikroDash will be documented in this file.

## [0.5.28]

### Fixed

- **Setup wizard — Test Connection always failed** — was calling `/api/test-connection` (non-existent endpoint); corrected to `/api/routers/test`.
- **Setup wizard — Connect button now locked until test passes** — Save is disabled on load and after any connection field change; only enabled after a successful Test Connection.

### Changed

- **README** — updated Quick Start (no `.env` required, first-run wizard), Settings table (Diagnostics row), Environment Variables section, Security Notice, and version pin.
- **`.env.example`** — all variables now commented out and optional; router/auth vars removed; note added for auto-generated `DATA_SECRET` and the Diagnostics UI toggle.

---

## [0.5.27]

### Fixed

- **Wireless — persistent partial-result drop (hAP ax2 / hAP AX³ / wifi-qcom)** — on devices with virtual APs, the wifi2 registration-table API consistently returns only the virtual AP's clients while physical-radio clients are intermittently absent; the previous absence guard (threshold=3) would eventually evict the physical-radio clients after 3 partial ticks. New guard: if the API returns > 0 but < 50% of known clients, the tick is treated as a suspected partial result and absence aging is frozen entirely until a full result returns.
- **Debug Logging toggle not saving** — `rosDebug` was missing from the `boolFields` whitelist in `POST /api/settings`, causing it to be silently ignored on every save; the toggle now persists correctly.
- **Wireless — map mutation during iteration** — `_knownClients.delete()` was called while iterating the live map keys; changed to snapshot the keys before iteration.

---

## [0.5.26]

### Added

- **First-run setup wizard** — when no router is configured, the web UI shows a full-screen guided overlay instead of a disconnected dashboard; covers all router fields (host, port, user/pass, TLS, default interface, ping target) with an inline Test Connection button; auto-activates the router on first save so the dashboard loads immediately after setup.
- **Debug Logging toggle** (Settings → Diagnostics) — enable or disable `ROS_DEBUG` verbose RouterOS API logging directly from the UI; takes effect immediately without restarting the container; `ROS_DEBUG` env var still overrides at startup if set.

### Changed

- **`.env` file no longer required** — all user-facing settings (router config, Basic Auth, encryption key) have moved to the UI and auto-generated secrets; only infrastructure-level overrides (PORT, MAX_SOCKETS, TRUSTED_PROXY, ROS_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS) remain env-configurable. `docker-compose.yml` updated accordingly.
- **Basic Auth no longer env-driven** — removed `BASIC_AUTH_USER`/`BASIC_AUTH_PASS` from startup defaults; existing values are migrated on first run so deployments upgrade without re-configuring; configure ongoing auth via Settings → Dashboard Auth.
- **Basic Auth middleware is now dynamic** — changes made in the Settings UI take effect on the next request without restarting the container.
- **`DATA_SECRET` auto-generated on first run** — a random 64-character key is generated and saved to `/data/.secret` (mode 0o600) if neither the env var nor the file exists; `DATA_SECRET` env var still takes priority when set.

### Fixed

- **Fresh installs no longer attempt a phantom RouterOS connection** — previously a dummy session to `127.0.0.1` was started when no router was configured, flooding logs with reconnect noise; server now waits silently for the first router to be added via the setup wizard.
- **Backwards-compat migration (settings.json → routers.json) no longer runs on new installs** — the seed was incorrectly triggered on fresh deployments where `settings.json` had never existed, inserting a dummy router and blocking no-router mode.

### Upgrade Note

> **Router passwords must be re-entered after upgrading from 0.5.25 or earlier.** The encryption key has changed from a hardcoded insecure default to a randomly generated per-instance key stored in `/data/.secret`. Stored router passwords encrypted with the old key can no longer be decrypted — open Settings → Routers after upgrading and re-enter passwords for each router.

---

## [0.5.24]

### Added

- **Configurable drag-and-drop dashboard grid** — 12×11 CSS grid with per-card drag, resize (8 handles), and swap-on-hover (1.5 s countdown with pulsing border animation); add/remove cards via the Add Card panel; Save/Discard/Reset controls; layout persists across sessions and devices.
- **Dashboard layout cross-device sync** — layout saved server-side to `/data/dashboard-layout.json` (same Docker volume as `routers.json`); any browser or device fetches the shared layout on load — no per-device reconfiguration.
- **14 optional dashboard cards** — hidden by default, user-addable via the Add Card panel: Signal Health, Band Split, Physical Ports, IP Utilisation, Connections Map (world map with animated arcs), Top Countries, Connection Flow (Sankey diagram), Top Ports, Routes by Protocol, BGP Peers, Bandwidth (utilisation bars), Firewall Actions, Total Hits, Logs.
- **Bandwidth card — utilisation bars** — two vertical fill bars (Download / Upload) showing real-time percentage of configured capacity using a 30-second rolling average; live numeric rate below each bar; animated fill transition.
- **Bandwidth capacity settings** — per-router Download and Upload capacity fields (Gbps/Mbps) in the router settings modal; drives the Bandwidth dashboard card utilisation bars.
- **Connections page — Filter by Client** — dropdown in the Connections Map card header filters the map, countries list, connection flow, and top ports to a single LAN device; populated from active connection sources merged with DHCP leases.
- **Connections page — `countryPorts` server-side index** — per-country top-10 port list built from every matching connection (no destination cap); replaces the previous approach that derived ports from the capped 20-entry `countryDests` list, fixing Top Ports undercounting when a country filter is active.
- **Connections page — `sourcePorts` server-side index** — per-source-IP top-10 port list built from every matching connection (no cap); used by the client filter, making Top Ports totals consistent with the badge count.
- **Connections Map card — connection count badge** — live connection count badge next to the card title, always blue when active (matches Wireless Clients, DHCP Leases, and WireGuard Peers badges); honours both country and client filters.
- **RouterOS UTF-8 encoding patch** — `patch-routeros.js` now patches `node-routeros` Receiver.js to decode API strings as UTF-8 instead of win1252; fixes Cyrillic, Greek, and all other non-Latin characters in device names, DHCP hostnames, interface labels, and comments.

### Changed

- **Router settings modal — Gbps/Mbps unit toggle** — replaced native `<select>` elements with fully-themed button toggles; the OS-rendered options popup was immune to dark-mode CSS regardless of `appearance` or `color-scheme` overrides.
- **Connections Map card header** — subtitle text removed; client filter dropdown is the sole right-side element and expands to fill available space.
- **Dashboard Bandwidth card** — "DL" / "UL" labels renamed to "Download" / "Upload".
- **Dashboard extra cards** — default sizes refined per card type (Signal Health 4×2, Band Split 2×2, Physical Ports 4×2, IP Utilisation 2×2, Connections Map 4×3, Top Countries 4×3, Connection Flow 4×4, Top Ports 2×3, Routes 3×3, BGP Peers 3×2, Bandwidth 2×3, Firewall Actions 4×3, Total Hits 2×2, Logs 5×3).

### Fixed

- **Country filter — Top Ports undercount** — ports were derived by parsing destination keys from the 20-entry-capped `countryDests` list; replaced with the new `countryPorts` server-side index which counts every matching connection.
- **Client filter — mismatched counts** — badge, map, and Top Ports each used a different source (authoritative server total, capped `srcDests` geo subset, key-regex extraction from capped list respectively); badge now uses `topSources` authoritative count, ports use the new uncapped `sourcePorts` index, map reflects geolocated subset as expected.
- **Dashboard extra cards — IP Utilisation** — field-name mismatch (`n.leases`/`n.poolSize` vs server-emitted `data.totalLeases`/`data.totalPoolSize`) caused the gauge to never render; corrected.
- **Dashboard extra cards — Routes donut** — rewrote centre-count logic and `connect` exclusion to match the Routing page exactly; donut now renders identically to its page counterpart.
- **Dashboard extra cards — Connection Flow** — Sankey diagram now renders inside the dashboard card using the same render path as the Connections page (shared `render()` with optional target elements).

---

## [0.5.23]

### Added

- **Settings — "Interface Rates" poll slider** — new slider in Settings → Poll Intervals, placed above Bandwidth, range 500 ms–30 s, 500 ms step. Controls the `InterfaceStatusCollector` poll interval. Changes apply immediately without a restart.

### Changed

- **`pollIfstatus` default lowered to 3,000 ms** — the default interface-rates poll interval has been reduced from 15,000 ms (raised in 0.5.20) to 3,000 ms, giving a responsive rate update cadence out of the box while staying comfortably above the RouterOS 1 s internal byte-counter tick boundary.
- **Interfaces card — targeted DOM updates** — the `ifstatus:update` handler was rewritten from full `ifaceGrid.innerHTML` replacement to per-tile in-place updates keyed on a `data-iface` attribute. Only changed elements are touched on each poll cycle, eliminating the redraw flash that the previous full-replacement approach produced.
- **Interfaces card — per-tile peak-relative rate bars** — RX and TX rate bars now scale relative to the highest rate seen per interface since page load, with a 0.5 % per-sample decay so the scale gradually tightens after a traffic burst subsides.
- **`cachedInterfaces` on session** — `sendInitialState` no longer issues a live `/interface/print` call for every new browser tab connection. The result is cached on the session object and invalidated only on RouterOS reconnect, saving one RouterOS API call per socket open.
- **Single `Settings.load()` in `sendInitialState`** — `Settings.load()` (which decrypts from disk) was called twice inside the same function. Hoisted to one call at the top, shared by both uses.
- **`RingBuffer` for logs history** — `LogsCollector` replaced a plain `Array` + O(n) `shift()` with the existing `RingBuffer` class from `src/util/ringbuffer.js`. Meaningful improvement on verbose routers with firewall logging enabled.
- **Shared `geoOrgCache` between Connections and Bandwidth** — both collectors call `geoip.lookup()` and `lookupOrg()` on the same external IPs drawn from the shared `connTableCache`. A single session-scoped `{ geo, org }` cache object is now passed into both constructors, eliminating duplicate lookups for every carry-over connection.
- **`countryDests` stripped from global `conn:update`** — the per-country destination index (up to 20 entries × N countries) was included in every `conn:update` broadcast every 3 s regardless of which page clients were viewing. It is now sent only to clients in the `page-connections` Socket.IO room via a separate `conn:country-data` event, shrinking the global payload significantly on nets with many external destinations.
- **Page-aware Socket.IO rooms** — `firewall:update` is now scoped to the `page-firewall` room, `bandwidth:update` to `page-bandwidth`, and `logs:new` to `page-logs`. Clients not currently viewing those pages no longer receive these high-frequency events. `page:focus` / `page:blur` socket events emitted by `showPage()` in `app.js` manage room membership; the `connect` handler re-joins the active room on reconnect.

### Fixed

- **Interfaces card — rate bars flashing to zero at 1 s poll interval** — the hybrid stream + poll approach introduced a race: RouterOS resets its `rx/tx-bits-per-second` field mid-cycle (~1 s), causing stream events to carry `bps=0` unpredictably; at ≤1 s poll rates the poll also sometimes fired before RouterOS updated its internal byte counters, producing a zero delta. The `/interface/listen` stream was removed entirely. The collector is now poll-only, computing rates from the byte-counter delta over the poll window. A sticky-rate guard holds the last non-zero rate for up to 3 consecutive zero-delta reads before accepting idle, absorbing the RouterOS tick-boundary race without stalling the display on genuinely idle interfaces.
- **Ping — sub-millisecond RTT displayed as milliseconds** — RouterOS returns RTTs under 1 ms as `"350us"` (microseconds). The parser was stripping the unit and displaying `350 ms` instead of `0.35 ms`. Fixed by capturing the unit suffix in the regex and dividing by 1000 when `us` is detected. Applied to both the summary-row and individual-reply parsing paths.
- **Spurious interface / VPN notifications on router switch** — `_notifPrevIface`, `_ifacePending`, and `_notifPrevVpn` retained state from the previous router, causing false up/down alerts (e.g. "ether1 up") immediately after switching because the same interface name on a different router had a different last-known state. All three maps are now cleared on the `router:switching` socket event.
- **Ping history not suppressed for new connections when ping is disabled** — when `pingEnabled=false`, `sendInitialState` now skips sending the ping history to newly connected sockets, preventing the frontend from briefly rendering stale ping data before the `ping:update { enabled: false }` suppression event arrives.

---

## [0.5.22]

### Fixed

- **TLS / API-SSL connection failing with self-signed certificate** — connections to the RouterOS `api-ssl` service (port 8729) with "Allow self-signed cert" enabled were being rejected with a TLS handshake error despite the setting being saved. Root cause: `_buildConn()` in the ROS client always converted the `tls` option to a boolean `true` before passing it to `node-routeros`, which then converted `true` → `{}` (empty options object), leaving `rejectUnauthorized` at its Node.js default of `true`. The `tlsOptions` field set as a workaround was never read by the library. Fixed by passing the TLS options object (`{ rejectUnauthorized: false }`) directly through to `node-routeros`, which forwards it unchanged to `tls.connect()`.

### Added

- **Settings — Disable Ping toggle** — new "Ping / Latency" toggle under Settings → Visible Pages → Dashboard widgets. When disabled, the ping section on the Network card is hidden immediately and the ping collector stops making RouterOS `/tool/ping` calls entirely. Re-enabling restarts the collector and restores the section live without a restart.

### Documentation

- **RouterOS TLS setup guide** — new step-by-step section in the README covering how to create a local CA, sign an api-ssl certificate, and bind it to the `api-ssl` service on RouterOS — no external CA or purchased certificate required.

---

## [0.5.21]

### Added

- **Routing — total route count in doughnut centre** — the total route count is now rendered in the centre hole of the Routes by Protocol doughnut chart, making the number visible at a glance without scanning the grid. The redundant Total tile in the grid is hidden (slot preserved to avoid reflowing the remaining tiles).
- **VPN Dashboard Top N setting** — new "VPN Dashboard Top N" field in Settings → Limits controls how many WireGuard peers are displayed on the main dashboard card (default 5, range 1–50). Configurable at runtime; takes effect on the next `vpn:update` event without a restart.

### Changed

- **Dashboard — WireGuard card sorted by handshake time** — connected peers are now ordered by most recent handshake first, so the most actively communicating peers always appear at the top of the card.
- **Dashboard — WireGuard peer count badge removed** — the peer count badge in the top-right of the WireGuard card was redundant with the sidebar nav badge and has been removed.

### Fixed

- **Dashboard — SVG flow animation runs during disconnect** — the animated flow dots on the network diagram continued moving when the router was disconnected or unreachable. The animation now pauses on both Socket.IO disconnect and RouterOS unreachable states, and resumes only when both connections are restored and the tab is visible.
- **VPN — peers missing after router reboot** — RouterOS returns a partial peer list when the WireGuard subsystem is still initialising after a reboot. The counter poll now acts as a recovery path: any peer found in `/print` that is not yet in the peer map is added immediately, without waiting for a stream event.

### Security

- **path-to-regexp** updated 0.1.12 → 0.1.13 (CVE-2026-4867 — ReDoS in Express route matching)
- **socket.io-parser** updated 4.2.5 → 4.2.6 (CVE-2026-33151 — unbounded binary attachment count)
- **brace-expansion** updated 1.1.12 → 1.1.13 (GHSA-f886-m6hf-6m8v — ReDoS in glob expansion)

## [0.5.20]

### Added

- **Interfaces page — Physical Ports card** — visual panel above the interface grid showing one RJ-45 port graphic per ethernet interface. Port size auto-scales (44 px for ≤ 8 ports down to 26 px for > 24 ports). Colour matches interface state: green for connected, red for disconnected, grey for disabled. Hover tooltip shows name, IP, and state. Wireless, bridge, VPN, and other non-physical interfaces are excluded.
- **Interfaces page — Interface Types card** — sits beside the Ports card; shows a colour-coded count tile per interface type (ether, wlan, bridge, vlan, wireguard, pppoe-client, lte, loopback, etc.), styled to match the Routes by Protocol card. The two cards share a responsive row that stacks on narrow viewports.
- **Wireless page — Band column** — colour-coded band pill (purple 2.4 GHz / blue 5 GHz / green 6 GHz) added between the Interface and Signal columns. Renders `—` when band data is unavailable from the RouterOS API.
- **VPN page — Summary stats bar** — four stat tiles above the peer grid: Total Peers, Connected, Idle, and Total Throughput (live sum of all active peer RX + TX rates). No additional API calls.
- **VPN page — Handshake age badge** — each peer tile shows a colour-coded badge: green (< 3 min, actively re-keying), amber (3–10 min, connected but quiet), red (> 10 min, likely stalled), grey (never completed a handshake). Thresholds align with WireGuard's ~3-minute re-key interval.
- **VPN page — Live RX/TX rates** — WireGuard peer tiles now show real-time per-peer receive and transmit rates. A dedicated counter poll (same pattern as the Firewall collector) re-fetches byte counters on every VPN poll interval and computes rates from byte deltas. The `/listen` stream continues to handle instant structural changes (peer add/remove).
- **Firewall page — Raw tab** — `/ip/firewall/raw` rules shown in a new Raw tab with the same columns (Chain, Action, Src → Dst, Comment, Packets, Bytes), in-place counter flash animation, search filter, and delta-pulse indicator as the Filter/NAT/Mangle tabs. Raw rule count added to the Rule Counts summary card.

### Changed

- **VPN poll interval** — Settings VPN slider changed from "Event-driven" badge to an active interval slider (500 ms – 30 s, default 10 s) since the collector now runs a counter poll. Changes apply immediately.
- **All sub-card title typography unified** — `wl-summary-title`, `fw-scard-title`, `if-scard-title`, `dhcp-card-title`, `rt-card-title`, `bw-chart-card-title`, and `vpn-stat-label` now all match the main `card-title` spec: `font-size: .82rem`, `font-weight: 600`, `letter-spacing: .04em`, `font-family: var(--font-ui)`. Previously each class had slightly different sizes, weights, and spacing.
- **Wireless poll default raised to 60 s** — wireless clients rarely change faster than once per minute; halving the default interval significantly reduces RouterOS API load on busy networks.
- **Interface status address poll raised to 15 s** — the address-refresh sub-poll inside `InterfaceStatusCollector` was running every 5 s; IPs rarely change so the interval has been raised to 15 s.
- **`connTableCache` TTL normalised to 1.0× the faster poll interval** — the shared firewall connection table cache (used by both Connections and Bandwidth collectors) now stays valid for a full poll cycle of the faster collector, eliminating the edge case where the cache expired just before a tick and triggered a redundant fetch.
- **Firewall counter poll uses `.proplist`** — the counter-refresh poll now requests only `.id`, `packets`, and `bytes` per rule rather than full rows, with an automatic fallback to a full fetch on RouterOS builds where proplist returns empty results.

### Fixed

- **Dashboard — center column cards not scaling on large displays** — the two center column cards (System and Network) did not resize correctly when dragging the browser window to a larger monitor. Root cause: CSS Grid's default `min-width: auto` combined with the SVG network diagram's intrinsic 340 px width prevented the column from shrinking. Fixed by adding `align-self: start` and `min-width: 0` to the center column and all its direct card descendants, including the SVG element itself.
- **Dashboard — center column cards staying large when dragging to small display** — complementary fix to the above; once the cards had grown larger on a big display, they would not shrink back. Same `min-width: 0` chain resolves both directions.
- **Wireless — clients flashing on each poll tick** — on `wifi-qcom` hardware with virtual APs, RouterOS occasionally returns a subset of connected clients (e.g. 1 of N) during radio re-association. The previous guard only caught a full-empty result; partial collapses bypassed it. Replaced with a per-MAC absence counter (`_absentTicks` map): a client is only removed after it has been absent for 3 consecutive ticks. New clients appear immediately.
- **Wireless — card goes stale intermittently** — `lastWirelessTs` was only updated when the collector emitted a new payload. During the transient-hold window while waiting to confirm a client count reduction, no heartbeat was written and the UI card greyed out after ~25 s. Fixed by updating the timestamp on every tick that executes, including hold-window ticks.
- **VPN — peer rates always zero** — RouterOS returns WireGuard byte counters as `"rx"` and `"tx"` (not `"rx-bytes"` / `"tx-bytes"`). The collector was reading the wrong field names, so `_prev` was never updated and rates were always 0. Field references corrected with firmware-compatibility fallback. Additionally, non-byte-counter stream events (e.g. handshake-only updates) were resetting the rate measurement window, causing the subsequent rate to report near-zero. Fixed by only advancing the timestamp baseline when byte values actually change.
- **Bandwidth — zero rates at fast poll intervals** — when both Connections and Bandwidth ran at similar intervals, the shared `connTableCache` could return an unchanged snapshot to the bandwidth collector. All byte deltas were zero, producing zero rates. Fixed by timestamping the cached snapshot and skipping the bandwidth tick entirely when the snapshot has not changed since the last tick.
- **Settings — poll sliders misaligned** — Firewall and Ping sliders had different `min`/`max` ranges (1 000–60 000 ms) from all other sliders (500–30 000 ms), making the same wall-clock value appear at different thumb positions. All six polled sliders normalised to `500–30 000 ms / 500 ms step`.

### Performance

- **HTTP response compression** — `compression` middleware added (gzip). Initial page load reduced from ~860 KB to ~150 KB (~5–7× reduction).
- **Vendor asset caching** — all files under `/vendor/` (Chart.js, Tabler, TopoJSON, fonts) are now served with a 7-day `Cache-Control` header. Returning visitors load these assets from the browser cache.
- **Idle gates on all collectors** — system resource polls and ping polls now skip their RouterOS API calls entirely when no browser clients are connected, matching the existing behaviour of Connections, Bandwidth, Talkers, Wireless, and Traffic collectors. On an unattended dashboard, RouterOS API traffic is now near zero across all data paths.
- **`requestAnimationFrame` debouncing** — all high-frequency DOM updates now batch to animation frames: system gauges, traffic chart, connections top sources/destinations, firewall structural re-renders, and bandwidth table. Rapid socket events no longer trigger redundant layout/paint work.
- **Page Visibility API** — when the browser tab is hidden, SVG network diagram animations are paused (`pauseAnimations()`) and all rAF DOM flushes are skipped. On tab return, animations resume and any data that accumulated while hidden is flushed immediately.
- **Traffic chart history preserved across navigation** — data points are now buffered into `allPoints` regardless of tab visibility or active page. Navigating away from the dashboard and returning, or switching browser tabs, no longer causes the traffic chart to lose its history. `redrawChart()` is called on dashboard page return and on tab visibility restore to render the full accumulated history.
- **System update check timeout** — `/system/package/update/print` now has a 5-second timeout guard. On devices that cannot reach the MikroTik upgrade server (CAPsMAN APs, firewalled deployments), the system gauges are no longer delayed.

## [0.5.15] — Firewall summary, Wireless & DHCP summary cards, Connections improvements

### Added

- **Firewall page — summary row** — three cards above the rules table: Rule Counts (Filter / NAT / Mangle totals with disabled count), Action Breakdown (proportional bars per action type with colour coding), and Total Hits (cumulative packet count, total bytes, and a live sparkline of activity).
- **Firewall page — search bar** — client-side filter across chain, action, src/dst address, comment, protocol, and port. Persists across tab switches.
- **Firewall page — Bytes column** — formatted byte totals added alongside Packets in all tabs.
- **Firewall page — in-place counter updates with flash animation** — packet and byte cells update in-place on each poll cycle with a colour flash.
- **Firewall page — delta pulse indicator** — animated dot beside the packet count on rules that matched traffic in the most recent poll cycle.
- **Firewall page — live counter polling** — RouterOS 7.x does not push firewall counter updates through `/listen`. A dedicated counter poll re-fetches counts on the Firewall interval setting. The stream still handles structural changes in real time.
- **Firewall poll interval setting** — Firewall slider added to Settings → Poll Intervals. Changes apply immediately without a restart.
- **Wireless page — Signal Health card** — horizontal bars showing client count per signal tier: Excellent (≥ −55 dBm), Good (≥ −65), Fair (≥ −75), Poor (< −75).
- **Wireless page — Band Split card** — 2.4 / 5 / 6 GHz client counts with colour-coded band pills. 6 GHz row auto-hides.
- **DHCP page — Subnets card** — per-network table with gateway, DNS, lease count, pool size, utilisation %, and colour-coded progress bar.
- **DHCP page — IP Utilisation gauge** — semi-circle SVG gauge driven live from the `leases:list` stream.
- **Connections page — Map fullscreen on desktop** — fullscreen button always visible, moved inside the map control panel.
- **Connections page — Sankey renders at correct width on navigation** — re-renders on `mikrodash:pagechange`.
- **Connections page — country filter** — clicking a country in Top Countries filters the Port Breakdown and Connection Flow to that country.

### Changed

- **Wireless page — Band column removed** from client table; band information moved to the Band Split summary card.
- **Wireless clients load immediately on startup** — first tick runs with `force=true`, bypassing the idle-gate.
- **DHCP page — Lease count includes all statuses** — exposes `getAllLeaseIPs()` for bound, waiting, and expired leases.
- **DHCP page — Pool size matched directly from IP ranges** — more reliable across bridge/VLAN configurations.
- **DHCP summary card heights** — `min-height: 165px` matching the Routing page.
- **`sendInitialState` sends full `lan:overview` payload** including `totalPoolSize`.
- **Connections page — Country filter persists across poll ticks** — `conn:update` re-applies the active country filter.
- **Connections page — map buttons work on desktop and mobile** — `mousedown` / `touchstart` handlers skip `preventDefault` for button targets.

### Fixed

- **Firewall rule metadata wiped on counter update** — `_applyUpdate` now merges stream deltas into existing rules rather than replacing them, preserving chain/action/comment.
- **Mangle rules excluded from dirty-check fp** — mangle counter changes now trigger `firewall:update` emit.
- **`[bandwidth] no such item (4)` log noise** — transient RouterOS error suppressed.
- **DHCP subnets card — Leases column overflow on mobile** — `white-space:nowrap` removed; `table-layout:fixed` added.
- **IP Utilisation gauge sub-label removed**.
- **Connections page — Sankey filter flag fixed** — deselecting a country no longer permanently freezes the Sankey.


## [0.5.14] — Optimisations, alert thresholds & bug fixes

### Added

- **Persistent alert thresholds** — CPU spike and ping loss notification thresholds are now configurable in Settings rather than hardcoded. Two sliders in a new "Alert Thresholds" card let you set the CPU % (default 90) and ping loss % (default 100) that trigger browser notifications. Values are stored in `settings.json` and broadcast to all connected clients via `settings:pages` so thresholds take effect immediately without a page refresh.
- **Timestamped Docker log output** — all console output is now prefixed with a local-time timestamp in the format `[2026-03-20 09:39:34]`, making `docker logs mikrodash` immediately readable without needing `docker logs --timestamps`.

### Changed

- **Idle-gating extended to four more collectors** — `ConnectionsCollector`, `BandwidthCollector`, `TopTalkersCollector`, and `WirelessCollector` now skip their `tick()` entirely when no browser clients are connected, matching the existing behaviour of `TrafficCollector`. On a quiet network with no dashboard open, RouterOS API traffic drops to near zero.
- **`connTableCache` TTL raised from 40% to 90% of the faster poll interval** — the shared firewall connection table cache used by both `ConnectionsCollector` and `BandwidthCollector` now stays valid for almost a full poll cycle of the faster collector, halving redundant RouterOS API calls when both collectors run at similar intervals.
- **Ping count reduced from 3 to 2** — each `/tool/ping` tick now sends 2 ICMP packets instead of 3, saving ~200ms of RouterOS API hold time per 10-second poll cycle with no meaningful loss of RTT accuracy.
- **Dirty-check fingerprinting added to five collectors** — `ConnectionsCollector`, `BandwidthCollector`, `TopTalkersCollector`, `DhcpNetworksCollector`, and `PingCollector` now suppress socket emits when their computed payload is identical to the previous tick. On stable networks this eliminates most redundant browser re-renders.
- **`stop()` method added to all collectors** — all 15 collectors now have a public `stop()` method. `teardownSession()` and `shutdown()` in `index.js` now call `c.stop()` uniformly rather than reaching into each collector's internal timer or stream fields.
- **`PingCollector` history uses `RingBuffer`** — the ping history ring buffer is now the same `RingBuffer` class used by `TrafficCollector`, replacing the plain array with manual `shift()`.
- **Unused `ArpCollector` import removed** from `test/collector-lifecycle.test.js`.

### Fixed

- **Ping target label not updating after router settings change** — editing the Ping Target in the Router card and saving now immediately broadcasts a `ping:update` to all connected clients so the dashboard label updates at once. Previously the label only changed after the next scheduled poll cycle (up to 10 seconds later). The fix is in the `PUT /api/routers/:id` handler, which is the correct save path for router-level settings including `pingTarget`.


## [0.5.13] — Wireless single-device display fix

### Fixed

- **Wireless page showing only one device on startup** — the 500ms name-resolution retry introduced in v0.5.12 was calling `tick()` again, which made a second RouterOS API call to the registration table. Some RouterOS firmware builds return partial results (1 of N clients) when the wifi registration table is queried within the first few seconds after boot — the same firmware sensitivity that caused the original `=.proplist=` single-client bug. The retry now re-resolves names from the already-fetched raw client rows stored in the closure rather than making any RouterOS API call, then re-emits only if names changed. If DHCP still hasn't loaded after 500ms the retry reschedules itself until all names are resolved.


## [0.5.12] — Wireless device names fix

### Fixed

- **Wireless page showing MAC addresses instead of device names** — `WirelessCollector.resolveName()` was caching empty strings when DHCP leases had not yet loaded on startup. Since `wireless.start()` fires before `dhcpLeases.start()` completes, the first tick resolved every MAC to `''` and stored it in `_nameCache`. All subsequent ticks hit the cache and never retried the DHCP lookup, so names were permanently blank. Fixed by only caching non-empty results: `if (name) this._nameCache.set(mac, name)`. Additionally, `name` is now included in the dirty-check fingerprint so the first tick that gains a resolved name triggers a socket emit to the browser even when MAC, signal, iface and band are unchanged.


## [0.5.11] — Bandwidth page flash fix

### Fixed

- **Bandwidth page alternating zeros/real-data flash** — `BandwidthCollector` and `ConnectionsCollector` had a double-start bug introduced in v0.5.10. Moving `ros.on('connected')` listeners to the constructor meant the handler fired on the initial connect and called `stop()` + `start()` — while `startCollectors()` in `index.js` *also* called `start()` explicitly on that same event. Two concurrent `setInterval` loops were created, interleaving ticks at roughly half the configured poll interval. The first tick of each pair always had a sparse `_prev` baseline (near-zero byte deltas → near-zero rates); the second had a full interval's worth of data. This produced the visible flash. Fixed by adding a `_started` flag to both collectors: the `connected` handler now only restarts the poll loop after a genuine reconnect (when `_started` is already true), leaving the initial start entirely to `startCollectors()`.


## [0.5.10] — Housekeeping & Test Suite Repair

### Fixed

- **`ConnectionsCollector` missing `stop()` method** — added canonical `stop()` that clears the poll timer. `ros.on('close')` and `ros.on('connected')` listeners are now registered once in the constructor rather than on every `start()` call, eliminating the risk of listener accumulation across reconnect cycles.
- **`BandwidthCollector` missing `stop()` method** — same fix as above. Cache maps (`_prev`, `_geoCache`, `_orgCache`, `_ifaceCache`) are still cleared on reconnect from the constructor listener.
- **`setInterval`-before-`run()` ordering in `ConnectionsCollector` and `BandwidthCollector`** — the poll timer is now set before the first `run()` call so the `close` event handler can always find and clear it, even if `run()` resolves synchronously in tests.
- **`BandwidthCollector` not writing to shared state** — `state.lastBandwidthTs` and `state.lastBandwidthErr` are now updated on every tick, consistent with all other collectors. `_freshState()` in `index.js` initialises both fields.
- **58 pre-existing test failures in `collector-data-transforms.test.js`** — all resolved:
  - Traffic tests: added missing `io.engine.clientsCount` to stubs.
  - Connections test: added `orgs: []` to `topCountries` deep-equal expected values (field was added in v0.5.8 but test was never updated).
  - Firewall, VPN, InterfaceStatus, ARP tests: these collectors were converted to streaming in prior sessions; tests were still calling the removed `tick()` method. Rewritten to call `_loadInitial()` (the correct entry point) with a minimal `stream` stub.
  - ARP tests: `getByIP`/`getByMAC` return `null` for missing entries; assertions corrected from `undefined` to `null`.
  - Wireless band test: band detection was refactored to read the RouterOS `band` field directly; test updated to supply that field in the ROS row stub.
  - Routing tests: `RoutingCollector` was used in 45 tests but never imported at the top of the routing section.
- **4 pre-existing test failures in `collector-lifecycle.test.js`** — all resolved:
  - Tests using `ArpCollector` as a "generic polling collector" subject: `ArpCollector` was converted to streaming in a prior session and no longer has `tick()` or a poll timer. Replaced with `DhcpNetworksCollector` (still polling) with a minimal `dhcpLeases` stub.
  - Inflight-reset test: rewrote to assert the correct contract (all collectors catch errors in `tick()` internally; `_inflight` must still reset after a failed tick).
- **1 pre-existing test failure in `smoke-fixes.test.js`** — `ROS emitter tolerates error events without a custom listener` was calling `ros.emit('error', ...)` directly, which is the standard Node.js `EventEmitter` throw path. Fixed to call `ros._emitConnectionError()` — the guarded method that only forwards to `error` when a listener exists.

### Added

- **14 new lifecycle tests** for `ConnectionsCollector` and `BandwidthCollector` (added in the same session as the production fixes): `stop()` existence and idempotency, close-event teardown, connected-event restart, listener non-accumulation across reconnects, inflight guard, and state timestamp/error tracking.

## [0.5.9] — Multi-Router Support

### Added

- **Multi-router management** — MikroDash can now connect to and monitor multiple MikroTik routers from a single instance. A new **Routers card** in Settings replaces the old Router Connection card. All configured routers are listed in a table with Edit and Delete actions. An **Add Router** button opens a modal with a full connection form (host, port, username, password, TLS, WAN interface, ping target, display name) and a **Test Connection** button that validates credentials against the live router before saving — on success the board name is automatically filled into the display name field.
- **Live router switcher** — a styled dropdown in the top-right of the page header (green pill with status dot) shows the currently active router and allows switching. On mobile, the same selector appears inside the slide-out navigation menu. Selecting a different router triggers an in-process hot-swap with no container restart or browser disconnect.
- **`/data/routers.json`** — new persistence file on the Docker data volume. Router passwords are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM using the same `DATA_SECRET`-derived key as `settings.json`. Existing deployments are migrated automatically: if `routers.json` does not exist on first start, a single entry is seeded from the existing `settings.json` credentials — no manual steps required.
- **Auto-labelling from board name** — newly added routers default to "My Router". After the first successful connection, MikroDash automatically updates the display name to the RouterOS board name (e.g. "hAP ax³"). The label is cleaned of ROS version suffixes before storage.
- **Name uniqueness** — if a display name already exists, a numeric suffix is appended: "hAP ax³ - [2]", "hAP ax³ - [3]", etc.
- **RouterOS update check resilience** — devices that cannot reach the MikroTik upgrade server (e.g. CAPsMAN-managed APs, restricted network positions) now show "Update check unavailable" in the System card instead of remaining stuck on "Checking for updates…" indefinitely.
- **Mobile navigation router selector** — the router switcher dropdown is included inside the mobile slide-out nav menu, visible only on small screens where the topbar selector is hidden.
- **Mobile burger menu toggle** — tapping the burger icon a second time now closes the navigation menu (previously it only opened it).

### Changed

- **In-process hot-swap on router switch** — switching routers tears down the active RouterOS connection and all 15 collectors, builds a fresh session for the new router, and begins connecting — all in-process in ~150ms. The Socket.IO server and HTTP server stay live throughout. All connected browser tabs receive fresh data from the new router automatically without a page refresh, including traffic history, DHCP leases, LAN overview, and all collector snapshots.
- **Router connection settings removed from Settings API** — host, port, credentials, and WAN interface are now managed exclusively through the Routers card and `/api/routers` endpoints. The global Settings validator no longer accepts these fields.
- **`settings.json` schema** — `activeRouterId` field added. Stores the UUID of the currently active router. Existing files remain valid.
- **Wireless poll interval maximum raised to 60 seconds** — previously capped at 30 seconds.
- **Poll interval sliders reordered** — Ping now appears above Wireless in the Settings poll interval section.
- **TLS toggle auto-fills port** — toggling Use TLS on/off in the Add/Edit Router modal now automatically fills the API port field (8729 for TLS, 8728 for plain), unless a custom port has already been entered.
- **Security guidance in `AI_CONTEXT.md`** — expanded Security model section with prescriptive requirements for new development: endpoint auth, input validation, credential handling, `.env` vs Settings boundary, frontend XSS rules, and dependency policy.

### Fixed

- **Traffic card goes stale after router switch** — after a hot-swap the server now broadcasts `sendInitialState` to all connected sockets once the new router's collectors are running. Previously, existing Socket.IO connections never received a new `traffic:history` event (only new connections did), leaving the chart blank until a manual page refresh.
- **DHCP page not updated after router switch** — same root cause as the traffic card; resolved by the same `sendInitialState` broadcast.
- **LAN overview (Network card) not updated after router switch** — `dhcpNetworks.tick()` is now awaited before `sendInitialState` broadcasts so `networks` and `wanIp` are populated immediately. Client-side `lastLanData` guard cleared on switch so incoming data is never silently discarded.
- **Destination Countries count not reset after router switch** — the connections map IIFE now clears its internal country caches and the card subtitle on `router:switching`, preventing old router's country count from persisting.
- **Router dropdown showing ROS version info** — the `system:update` handler was overwriting the select option text with `boardName + ' · ROS ' + version` on every system poll. Removed. The dropdown now only ever uses the stored label from `routers.json`. A strip regex also guards against stale labels already on disk.


## [0.5.8] — Routing & Wireless: Full Streaming, Interface Sparklines

### Added

- **Interface page sparklines** — each interface card now shows a traffic trend sparkline in the top-right corner. Plots combined RX+TX Mbps over the last 30 samples (~2.5 minutes at default 5 s poll). Baseline-anchored at zero. Inline SVG, no additional data source required.
- **Streaming-first architecture** — all collectors that support a RouterOS `/listen` endpoint now use event-driven streaming instead of polling. New constraint documented in `AI_CONTEXT.md`.

### Changed

- **`RoutingCollector` fully converted to streaming** — both the route table and BGP sessions are now event-driven with no poll timer:
  - `/ip/route/listen` — route table maintained as an in-memory `Map`, updated incrementally by delta rows (add/update/delete). Partial delta rows are merged with the stored raw row so unmodified fields are preserved.
  - `/routing/bgp/session/listen` — BGP session state delivered instantly. Keepalive-only events (uptime/counter tick with unchanged state and prefix count) are fingerprint-suppressed to avoid unnecessary browser re-renders.
  - `/routing/bgp/peer/print` — peer config (names, descriptions) loaded once on connect; refreshed only when a meaningful session state change is detected.
  - 60-second heartbeat re-emit keeps client stale timers alive on stable networks.
  - Graceful fallback when BGP stream endpoint is unavailable (RouterOS v6, non-BGP builds).
- **Routing poll interval slider removed from Settings** — replaced with an "Event-driven" badge, consistent with Interfaces, VPN, Firewall, and ARP.
- **`AI_CONTEXT.md` expanded** — collector delivery model table added; RouterOS API quirks section added; streaming collector pattern documented as the default with polling as the explicit fallback.

### Fixed

- **Wireless page shows only one client** — `=.proplist=` on the wifi/wireless registration-table calls was causing some RouterOS v7 firmware builds to *filter rows* (returning only rows where all requested fields are non-empty) rather than silently omitting absent fields. Only the one client that happened to satisfy the full proplist was returned. Fix: `=.proplist=` removed from both registration-table calls.
- **Routing page data disappears after first poll or reconnect** — `start()` was registering a new `ros.on('connected')` listener on every call, doubling the count on each reconnect cycle (1→2→4→8→…). After a few reconnects multiple concurrent chains raced to call `stop()`, each clearing the timer the previous chain had just created. Fixed by registering listeners exactly once — same pattern as all other collectors.
- **Active routes disappear, one disabled route remains** — RouterOS v7 omits `.flags` for routes in their default active state on some firmware builds; disabled routes always carry `.flags`. Streaming via `/ip/route/listen` eliminates the inconsistency as stream events always carry the full row.
- **Connected routes flicker in the routes table every poll cycle** — the IP-gateway fallback inference passed for RouterOS interface-name gateways (`bridge`, `ether1`, `vlan10`). Fixed by requiring the gateway to match an actual IP address pattern.
- **`pollTalkers` live interval change had no effect** — `talkers` was missing from `collectorMap` in the settings POST handler.
- **`settings:pages` missing fields** — `sendInitialState()` omitted `pageBandwidth`; the settings reset branch omitted both `pageBandwidth` and `pageRouting`.
- **Malformed RouterOS field values produced `NaN`** — all numeric field conversions now use a `safeInt()` helper that returns `0` for non-numeric strings.


## [0.5.7] — Routing Page, BGP Monitoring, arm64 Support & Fixes

### Added

- **Routing page** — new sidebar page covering the full router routing state:
  - **Routes by Protocol card** — doughnut chart (Static / Dynamic / BGP / OSPF) embedded in the card alongside a count grid. Connected routes shown in the grid but excluded from the chart.
  - **Static & Dynamic Routes table** — sortable, filterable table with destination, gateway, distance, active state, type badge, and comment.
  - **BGP Peers table** — per-peer session state, ASN, uptime, prefix count, updates in/out, last error, and a per-peer prefix trend sparkline. Sortable by all columns. Filterable by state, peer type (Upstream / IX / Private), and IPv4/IPv6. Full-text search.
  - **BGP Peers summary card** — total, established, and down peer counts.
  - **Peer type classification** — peers auto-classified as Upstream, IX/Route-Server, or Private using RFC6996 ASN ranges and description keywords.
  - **Session flap detection** — 3+ state transitions within 5 minutes marks a peer as flapping with a pulsing badge.
  - **BGP alert notifications** — peer down/up, prefix count change ≥20%, session flapping, and hold-timer warnings integrated into the existing notification system.
  - **`pollRouting` setting** — dedicated poll interval slider (1s–10min) in Settings. Defaults to 10s.
- **DHCP page sortable columns** — Hostname, IP, MAC, and Status columns now sortable with sort arrows. Default sort is IP ascending.
- **`pollTalkers` setting** — Top Talkers has its own independent poll interval, no longer tied to Connections.
- **Routing nav badge** — live total route count shown next to Routing in the sidebar.

### Performance & Reliability

- **Routing API efficiency** — all route data (type classification, counts, table rows) derived from a single `/ip/route/print` call using RouterOS `.flags` string parsing. Eliminates up to 8 concurrent API writes per tick that were causing intermittent ROS disconnects.
- **Route flag parsing** — uses RouterOS's compact `.flags` string (`A`=active, `S`=static, `D`=dynamic, `b`=bgp, `o`=ospf) with fallback to individual boolean fields. Reliable across all RouterOS v7 builds — previous `?static=yes` / `?dynamic=yes` filter approach returned inconsistent results on some firmware versions.
- **WAN IP on first load** — falls back to extracting the WAN IP from interface status data when the DHCP Networks collector hasn't completed its first tick yet.

### Docker

- **`linux/arm64` support** — multi-arch image (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) published via GitHub Actions on every `v*.*.*` tag. Covers Raspberry Pi 4/5, R5S, and Apple M-series. QEMU used for cross-compilation; native layers at runtime.
- **`.dockerignore` added** — reduces image build context size.

### Bug Fixes

- **DHCP Networks poll interval** — server-side validator now accepts values up to 10 minutes, matching the Settings UI slider.
- **Routing page dropdowns** — search and select inputs now correctly follow the dark/light theme using CSS variables with `html[data-theme="light"]` overrides.
- **Routing stale cards** — stale thresholds now sync from `pollRouting` via the settings payload before the first data event arrives, preventing premature stale state on slow-polling configurations.


## [0.5.6] — Streaming Architecture, Router CPU Optimisations & Bug Fixes

### Streaming — event-driven collectors (replaces polling)

Four collectors converted from fixed-interval polling to RouterOS `/listen` streams.
Each opens a persistent stream on connect, receives only delta rows when something
changes, and falls back to a full `/print` reload on stream error. A 60-second
heartbeat emit keeps stale-detection timers alive when data is stable.

- **Firewall** (`/ip/firewall/filter/listen`, `/nat/listen`, `/mangle/listen`) —
  three concurrent streams replace the 10-second poll. Rule changes and counter
  updates appear instantly. Eliminates 18 API calls/min at default interval.
- **VPN / WireGuard** (`/interface/wireguard/peers/listen`) — stream fires on
  handshake and byte-counter updates. Eliminates 6 API calls/min.
- **Interface Status** (`/interface/listen`) — stream fires on up/down state
  changes for instant tile colour updates. A lightweight 5-second stats poll
  (scoped to counter fields only) runs in parallel to drive the live rate bars,
  since byte counters are not pushed through the listen stream.
- **ARP** (`/ip/arp/listen`) — stream fires when devices appear, disappear, or
  change MAC binding. Eliminates 2 API calls/min; new devices now appear
  instantly rather than within the previous 30-second poll window.

### Performance — `.proplist` field scoping

RouterOS sends all available fields per row unless told otherwise. Added
`=.proplist=` to every remaining unscoped collector to request only the fields
MikroDash actually reads, reducing per-call payload size:

- **Connection table cache** — 7 fields requested instead of ~15 per entry.
  With large connection tables (hundreds to thousands of entries polled at 3s)
  this is the single largest wire-traffic reduction.
- **Interface Status** — scoped to 10 fields for `/interface/print` and 2 for
  `/ip/address/print`.
- **Top Talkers** — scoped to 4 fields for `/ip/kid-control/device/print`.
- **System** — scoped to 11 fields for `/system/resource/print`.
- **Wireless** — scoped to 12 fields for both registration table APIs
  (`/interface/wifi/registration-table/print` and
  `/interface/wireless/registration-table/print`).

### Performance — additional optimisations

- **Socket.IO `perMessageDeflate`** — WebSocket per-message deflate enabled at
  compression level 1. Repetitive JSON payloads (connection tables, interface
  lists) typically compress 60–80%.
- **Shared connection table cache** — `ConnectionsCollector` and
  `BandwidthCollector` share a single `/ip/firewall/connection/print` fetch
  per cycle. Cache TTL is now **40% of the faster collector's poll interval**
  (previously a fixed 1500ms) so it works correctly at any poll rate including
  1-second bandwidth polling.
- **Traffic collector idle-gating** — `/interface/monitor-traffic` API calls
  are skipped entirely when no browser clients are connected
  (`io.engine.clientsCount === 0`). Eliminates 60 API calls/min when the
  dashboard is unattended.
- **Firewall / VPN / wireless emit fingerprinting** — socket emits suppressed
  when payload content is unchanged between ticks.
- **System collector** — `/system/package/update/print` decoupled from the
  resource/health tick into a separate background call with a 5-minute
  sub-interval. RouterOS must reach its update server to resolve this call;
  previously this blocked CPU/RAM gauges from appearing on first load.
  Update status now emits independently when it resolves.
- **`system:update` static metadata written once** — board name, ROS version,
  CPU count/frequency, and total RAM never change after boot. `sysMeta`
  is now written to the DOM on the first payload only; subsequent ticks update
  only the dynamic fields (gauges, uptime, temperature).
- **`ts` excluded from client-side connection fingerprints** — previously the
  `ts` timestamp caused fingerprint mismatches on every tick regardless of
  whether data changed.
- **`_updateBwStats` page-visibility gated** — bandwidth stat card and chart
  sync only run when the bandwidth page is active.
- **Country list server-side cap** — `conn:update` slices `topCountries` to
  30 entries before emitting.

### Settings page — poll intervals

- **Streamed collectors** (Interfaces, VPN, Firewall, ARP) no longer show
  editable sliders — replaced with a green **"Event-driven"** badge since their
  data delivery is not controlled by a poll interval.
- **Poll interval sliders reordered** — all configurable (polled) collectors
  listed first, event-driven badges grouped below.
- **`pollTalkers`** added as an independent setting for the Top Talkers card.
  Previously it was silently tied to the Connections interval with no way to
  control it separately.

### Bug Fixes

- **Interfaces page traffic counters not updating** — `/interface/listen` fires
  only on structural changes (up/down), not on byte-counter increments. The
  stats poll now fetches counter fields on the configured interval and merges
  them into the stored interface rows, restoring live rate bars.
- **WireGuard card stale on dashboard** — streamed collectors have no regular
  emit cadence when data is unchanged (e.g. idle peers). All three streamed
  collectors (firewall, VPN, ifStatus) now emit a 60-second heartbeat so the
  stale-detection timer never fires while the stream is healthy. Stale
  thresholds for these cards raised to 90s.
- **Bandwidth table blank on every other tick at 1s poll** — fixed cache TTL
  mismatch: the shared connection table cache had a fixed 1500ms TTL, so at
  1s bandwidth polling every second tick returned the same cached rows, making
  all byte deltas zero. TTL is now 40% of the minimum poll interval.
- **"Checking for updates" stuck on dashboard** — `/system/package/update/print`
  was bundled into the first resource/health tick. RouterOS must reach its
  update server to resolve this, blocking CPU/RAM gauges from appearing.
  Update check now runs in the background and never delays the gauge emit.
- **WAN IP slow to appear on page load** — `sendInitialState` emitted
  `lan:overview` without the `wanIp` field. The IP is now included from the
  cached `state.lastWanIp` value so it appears immediately on connect.
- **Top Talkers poll interval uncontrollable** — talkers was constructed with
  `pollMs: _cfg.pollConns` and had no entry in the live poll-update map.
  Changing the Connections slider silently moved both; there was no way to set
  them independently. Now has its own `pollTalkers` setting.

## [0.5.5] — Bandwidth Page, Performance & Reliability

### Added
- **Bandwidth page** — new dedicated page showing live per-connection bandwidth, accessible from the sidebar. Displays all active firewall connections with real-time RX, TX, and Total Mbps, sortable by any column (default: Total descending)
- **Compact WAN traffic chart** — a 120 px inline Chart.js graph sits above the bandwidth table, mirroring the dashboard traffic feed with no extra API calls
- **RX / TX stat card** — a combined card beside the chart shows live WAN receive and transmit rates, split into value and unit spans for stable right-aligned layout
- **ASN / Org column on Bandwidth page** — uses the same `svcBadge()` colour coding as the Connections page (CDN blue, cloud orange, social purple, etc.)
- **Destination column with geo flag** — shows country flag, ISO code, and city; city is suppressed when it duplicates the country code or is a single character
- **Interface column** — resolved server-side via subnet CIDR matching against the live interface list; no RouterOS field read needed
- **Interface dropdown filter** — seeded from all running interfaces via `ifstatus:update`; DOM only rebuilds when the sorted list actually changes, eliminating per-tick flicker
- **Search + dropdown toolbar** — search box expands to fill all available space; interface and protocol dropdowns are pinned to the right
- **`pollBandwidth` and `pageBandwidth` settings** — both fields were previously silently dropped by the settings validator; both are now accepted and applied correctly

### Performance
- **Shared `/ip/firewall/connection/print` cache** — `ConnectionsCollector` and `BandwidthCollector` previously each fetched the full connection table independently every 3 s (~40 API calls/min combined). Both now read from a shared 1.5 s TTL cache in `index.js`, halving RouterOS API load. Cache is invalidated on disconnect
- **Traffic collector idle-gating** — the 1 s `/interface/monitor-traffic` poll is skipped entirely when no browser clients are connected (`io.engine.clientsCount === 0`), eliminating 60 API calls/min when the dashboard is unattended. The interval continues running so data resumes immediately on reconnect
- **`perMessageDeflate` on Socket.IO** — WebSocket per-message deflate enabled (compression level 1) reducing repetitive JSON payload sizes by 60–80% with negligible CPU overhead
- **Fingerprint-gate on `firewall`, `vpn`, and `wireless` emits** — each collector computes a lightweight fingerprint over its structural data before emitting; the socket write is suppressed when nothing has changed. Firewall rules and VPN peers are stable for hours at a time
- **`_resolveIface` result cache** — bandwidth collector caches subnet-to-interface resolution per source IP in a `Map`, cleared on reconnect. Eliminates repeated CIDR iteration for the same stable LAN hosts every tick
- **Server-side country list cap** — `conn:update` now slices `topCountries` to 30 entries before emitting; the client never renders more than this
- **`ts` excluded from client-side fingerprints** — connection source and destination fingerprints previously hashed the full object including `ts`, which changes every tick regardless of data. Fingerprints now hash only the meaningful fields
- **`_updateBwStats` page-visibility gate** — bandwidth RX/TX stat card and chart sync only run when the bandwidth page is active

### Bug Fixes
- **Interfaces page stale** — `InterfaceStatusCollector` was fingerprint-suppressing emits when interface up/down state and IPs were unchanged. Because rates change every tick, the stale timer never reset and the page marked itself stale after ~25 s. The collector now always emits unconditionally
- **Bandwidth table columns shifting on refresh** — added `table-layout:fixed` and a `<colgroup>` with explicit percentage widths for all 8 columns. Cells receive `overflow:hidden; text-overflow:ellipsis` so long content truncates within the fixed width rather than pushing columns
- **`fmtMbps` HTML injection in bandwidth stat card** — a local `fmtMbps` inside the bandwidth IIFE returned a `<span>` string for zero values; the card used `textContent` so the raw HTML rendered as literal text. Local override removed; global plain-text version handles all cases
- **`networksCard` false-stale** — stale grace period widened from 20 s to 45 s (300 s poll × 15%) to accommodate slow RouterOS DHCP responses. The stale timer now also resets on `ping:update` (every 10 s), since the card displays live ping data and should never appear stale while the router is reachable

### UI
- **Page-wide disconnect fade** — when either the Socket.IO connection or the RouterOS connection drops and the reconnecting banner appears, the entire page (`#sidenav` and `#main`) fades to 35% opacity with `pointer-events:none` and a 0.35 s transition, matching the visual language of individual stale cards. Cleared immediately on reconnect

## [0.5.4] — Performance, Settings & DHCP Improvements

### Added
- **Settings page** — new page accessible via a gear icon pinned to the bottom of the sidebar; About moved below Settings
- **Persistent settings store** (`src/settings.js`) — saves to `/data/settings.json` on the Docker volume; merges over `.env` values on boot so existing deployments are unaffected
- **AES-256-GCM credential encryption** — router password and dashboard password are encrypted at rest using a key derived from the `DATA_SECRET` env var
- **`GET /api/settings`** — returns current settings with credentials masked as `••••••••`
- **`POST /api/settings`** — validates and saves settings; applies poll interval changes live without restart; broadcasts page visibility changes to all connected clients; returns `requiresRestart: true` if router connection fields changed
- **Live poll interval sliders** — all collector poll intervals adjustable via range sliders; changes take effect immediately without restart
- **Page visibility toggles** — any page except Dashboard and Settings can be hidden; hidden pages are removed from the sidebar instantly; active page redirects to Dashboard if hidden
- **Router connection settings** — host, port, username, password, TLS toggle, self-signed cert toggle, default WAN interface, ping target
- **Dashboard auth settings** — HTTP Basic Auth username and password configurable from the UI
- **Limits settings** — Top N connections/talkers/firewall rules, max connections, traffic history minutes
- **Reset to defaults** button — restores all settings to compiled-in defaults
- **Docker volume** — `docker-compose.yml` now mounts a named `mikrodash-data` volume at `/data`

### Changed
- **Boot from settings** — `index.js` reads router credentials and all poll intervals from the settings store on startup; `.env` vars still seed the defaults if no `settings.json` exists yet
- **DHCP Networks poll default raised to 5 min (300,000 ms)** — network definitions and WAN IP are static config that rarely change; lease counts are derived from the in-memory store so are unaffected. Slider range updated to 30 s – 10 min; `.env.example` updated to match
- **Merged duplicate socket listeners** — `ifstatus:update`, `vpn:update`, `system:update`, and `ping:update` each previously registered two handlers (render + notification); consolidated into single handlers
- **`system:update` dirty-checking** — gauges, sys-meta, and update row fingerprinted; DOM only rebuilt when values change
- **`ifstatus:update` dirty-checking** — interface grid skips full `innerHTML` rewrite when name/state/rates are unchanged
- **Wireless dirty-checking** — wireless table skips rebuild when MAC/signal/tx-rate/uptime are unchanged
- **`renderCountryList` dirty-checking** — skips rewrite when data and selection are unchanged
- **`renderPortList` dirty-checking** — skips rebuild when data is unchanged
- **Page-visibility gating** — country/port lists, interface grid, wireless table, and firewall table skip all DOM work when the tab is hidden or the relevant page is not active
- **Log count badge debounce** — `updateLogCounts()` debounced to 250 ms during rapid log bursts
- **Map tooltip `getBoundingClientRect()` cached** — rect cached per hover session, invalidated on resize; eliminates a forced layout reflow on every `mousemove`
- **Map pulse animation via `rAF` double-frame** — replaces forced synchronous reflow used to restart CSS animations
- **Per-tick GeoIP dedup** (`connections.js`) — `geoLookup()` called at most once per unique destination IP per tick
- **Wireless MAC name cache** (`wireless.js`) — `getNameByMAC()` result cached between ticks in a `Map`; cleared on reconnect

### Server
- **Event-driven DHCP lease updates** (`dhcpLeases.js`) — removed 15-second periodic `leases:list` broadcast; `_applyLease` now emits an updated lease table immediately on any change from the live stream; `_loadInitial` emits once after startup `/print`
- **Removed `pollMs` from `DhcpLeasesCollector`** — no longer accepts a poll interval; `LEASES_POLL_MS` env var has no effect and can be removed from `.env`
## [0.5.3] — UI & Accuracy Improvements

### Features

- **Per-band wireless client counts** — the Wireless Clients card header now
  shows live counts per band (`2.4GHz: N`, `5GHz: N`, and `6GHz: N` when
  present), separated from the total count badge by a thin vertical divider
  (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **ASN / org lookup on Connections page** — destination IPs are resolved to
  organisation names via a curated CIDR→org table with a 5000-entry LRU cache,
  displayed as a label beneath each IP:port entry; no new runtime dependencies
  (`src/util/asnLookup.js`, `src/collectors/connections.js`,
  `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **Service badge colour coding** — destinations are grouped into seven
  categories (cdn, cloud, social, streaming, messaging, video, dns) with
  distinct coloured inline badges in Top Destinations, org sub-rows in Top
  Countries, and IP tooltips on hover (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`,
  `src/util/asnLookup.js`, `src/collectors/connections.js`)
- **Connection Flow Sankey diagram** — a pure-SVG source→destination flow
  diagram rendered at the bottom of the Connections page, driven by
  `conn:update` data, with proportional ribbon widths, category colours, and
  resize-awareness; no external library (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **Log count indicators** — four clickable severity pill badges (`N errors`,
  `N warnings`, `N info`, `N debug`) in the Logs card header tally the buffer
  by severity, toggle the severity filter on click, and remain visible at zero
  count (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Wireless band detection uses RouterOS registration table directly** —
  the previous heuristic based on interface name patterns and tx-rate strings
  (`MHT-xxx`, `HE-MCS`) incorrectly reported 5GHz for some 2.4GHz clients.
  The collector now reads the `band` field directly from each registration
  table entry — the same authoritative source Winbox displays in its Band
  column (`src/collectors/wireless.js`)
- **Ping target label updates dynamically** — `<span id="pingTargetLabel">`
  is now updated from `data.target` in both `ping:history` and `ping:update`
  handlers (`public/app.js`)
- **Wired client count uses interface type allowlist** — count now derives
  from `type === 'ether'` entries in `ifstatus:update` rather than the talkers
  list, avoiding false positives (`public/app.js`)

### UI

- **Connections page layout reorganised** — Top Countries now spans the full
  page width; Connection Flow and Top Ports share the row below it at a
  `2fr 1fr` split (`public/index.html`)
- **Sankey diagram taller** — minimum height raised from 180px to 260px and
  per-source row height increased from 24px to 36px (`public/app.js`)
- **Service badge colours fully distinct** — `svc-video` changed from blue
  (conflicting with `svc-cdn`) to amber; `svc-dns` changed from green
  (conflicting with `svc-messaging`) to teal; Sankey ribbon colours updated
  to match (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **Log count badges more visible** — background and text opacities raised
  across all four severity levels; debug badge no longer uses the near-invisible
  `--text-muted` colour (`public/index.html`)
- **Country list sparklines moved to top-right** — the per-country sparkline
  is repositioned to the top-right of the country name row using a flex
  space-between wrapper (`public/app.js`)
- **Nav logo no longer jumps on expand/collapse** — logo previously switched
  between `justify-content:center` and `flex-start` mid-transition; it now
  sits permanently left-aligned with `padding:0 14px`, matching the nav icons,
  with no animated properties (`public/index.html`)
- **Traffic card width on mobile fixed** — removed a redundant inner wrapper
  div that caused the Traffic card to render slightly narrower than sibling
  cards on mobile viewports (`public/index.html`)
- **Mobile topbar decluttered** — clock and router tag spans hidden at ≤767px
  via `.topbar-mobile-hide` (`public/index.html`)
- **Mobile dashboard scaling** — `.page-view` padding reduced on small screens;
  grid gaps tightened; connections card set to `height:auto` on narrow
  viewports; `connMapList` grid uses `minmax(min(220px,100%),1fr)` to prevent
  horizontal overflow (`public/index.html`)

## [0.5.2] — UI Improvements & Bug Fixes

### Features

- **Live interface traffic rates on Interfaces page** — each interface tile now
  displays real-time RX and TX rates with colour-coded bar indicators (blue for
  RX, green for TX) that scale relative to the session peak. Rates are derived
  from cumulative byte counter deltas between polls, since
  `rx-bits-per-second` is not available from `/interface/print`
  (`src/collectors/interfaceStatus.js`, `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **Log persistence across page refreshes** — the server now maintains a
  ring buffer of the last 500 log entries (configurable via `LOG_HISTORY_SIZE`)
  and replays them to each new socket connection, so the Logs page is no longer
  blank after a refresh (`src/collectors/logs.js`, `src/index.js`,
  `public/app.js`)
- **Self-hosted fonts** — JetBrains Mono and Syne are now bundled as woff2
  files under `public/vendor/fonts/`, eliminating the last remaining external
  requests to Google Fonts and completing the fully air-gapped deployment story
  (`public/vendor/fonts/`, `public/index.html`)

### UI

- **Item count badges on Interfaces and VPN pages** — the Interfaces card and
  the WireGuard Peers card now show a count badge matching the style used on
  Wireless Clients and DHCP (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **Consistent card badge styling across all pages** — all five card badges
  (Wireless Clients, DHCP, WireGuard dashboard, WireGuard Peers, Interfaces)
  now use a shared `.card-badge` CSS class with CSS variable-based colours that
  are legible in both dark and light mode, replacing the Tabler `bg-*` classes
  that were invisible in light mode (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Notification bell invisible in light mode** — the bell SVG had an inline
  `stroke:var(--text-muted)` overriding `currentColor`, a blanket `opacity:.85`
  on the button, and no explicit `width`/`height` on dynamically injected SVGs,
  causing it to be nearly invisible or zero-sized. All three issues resolved
  (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **ROS and reconnect banners stacking** — when the router disconnected,
  both the amber RouterOS banner and the red Socket.IO reconnect banner could
  appear simultaneously. The reconnect banner now suppresses the ROS banner
  while active, and restores it on reconnect only if the router is still
  offline (`public/app.js`)
- **VPN peer dot hidden on long peer names** — the status dot in WireGuard
  peer tiles was clipped when the peer name was long due to `overflow:hidden`
  applied to the flex container. The dot is now `flex-shrink:0` and truncation
  applies only to the name text span (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)

## [0.5.1] — Production Resilience Hardening

### Security

- **Self-hosted frontend assets and tightened CSP** — the dashboard now serves
  vendored Chart.js, TopoJSON, world-atlas, and Tabler assets locally instead
  of loading them from third-party CDNs. Helmet configuration was extracted
  into a dedicated module and tightened to a self-hosted Content Security
  Policy (`src/security/helmetOptions.js`, `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`,
  `public/vendor/`)
- **Startup patch verification for `node-routeros`** — application startup now
  hard-fails if the required MikroDash compatibility markers are missing from
  the patched `node-routeros` files, preventing silent boot with a broken
  runtime (`src/index.js`)
- **Socket.IO connection cap** — the server now applies a configurable
  `MAX_SOCKETS` limit and caps Socket.IO message size, reducing abuse surface
  on LAN deployments (`src/index.js`)

### Reliability

- **Per-command RouterOS write timeout with forced reconnect** — one-shot
  RouterOS API calls now use a configurable timeout budget
  (`ROS_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS`) and close the active shared connection on timeout so
  the existing reconnect loop can recover cleanly (`src/routeros/client.js`)
- **Inflight guards across polling collectors** — all interval-based
  collectors now skip overlapping runs instead of stacking concurrent RouterOS
  calls when a slow tick exceeds its poll interval (`src/collectors/*.js`)
- **Graceful shutdown with unref’d fallback timer** — shutdown now stops
  RouterOS, Socket.IO, and HTTP resources in order and uses an unref’d 5-second
  forced-exit timer so the fallback does not keep the process alive on its own
  (`src/index.js`, `src/shutdown.js`)
- **RouterOS patch verification and write-timeout helpers extracted for testable
  runtime behavior** — health/CSP/shutdown support code was split into small
  modules to make the hardening logic independently testable
  (`src/health.js`, `src/security/helmetOptions.js`, `src/shutdown.js`)

### Operations

- **`/healthz` now behaves like readiness** — the endpoint returns `503` until
  startup completes or when RouterOS is disconnected, and now includes a
  `startupReady` flag in the JSON body (`src/index.js`, `src/health.js`)
- **Connection-table processing cap metadata** — the connections collector now
  reports the raw total separately from the number of rows processed, exposing
  `processed` and `processingCapped` to make truncation explicit (`src/collectors/connections.js`)
- **Auth failure tracking cap** — the in-memory auth failure map now evicts the
  oldest tracked IPs once it exceeds `maxTrackedIPs`, bounding memory growth
  under probe traffic (`src/auth/basicAuth.js`)
- **Wireless API probe debug logging** — failed wireless capability probes now
  log at debug level instead of failing silently (`src/collectors/wireless.js`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Info-page logo path normalized** — the about/info page now uses `/logo.png`
  like the rest of the app, avoiding broken image resolution on non-root paths
  (`public/index.html`)
- **Removed stale vendored CSS sourcemap reference** — the checked-in Tabler CSS
  no longer advertises a missing `.map` file, eliminating pointless 404s in
  browser devtools (`public/vendor/tabler.min.css`)
- **`package.json` version now matches app version** — `package.json` was
  still reporting `0.4.8` while `app.js`, the changelog, and `/healthz` all
  reported `0.5.0`; version bumped to `0.5.1` to resolve the mismatch
  (`package.json`)
- **`.log-line` CSS rule added** — `buildLogHtml()` wraps each entry in
  `<div class="log-line">` but no matching rule existed; added `.log-line`
  with `display:block`, `padding`, and a subtle hover highlight
  (`public/index.html`)
- **Log colours now visible in light mode** — `.log-error`, `.log-warning`,
  `.log-debug`, `.log-info` and all topic classes (`.log-dhcp`,
  `.log-wireless`, `.log-firewall`, `.log-system`) had no
  `html[data-theme="light"]` overrides, making several severity levels
  nearly invisible on a light background; 12 light-mode rules added
  (`public/index.html`)

### Features

- **RouterOS offline banner** — a yellow warning banner now appears at the
  top of the dashboard whenever RouterOS is not reachable, with a plain-
  English reason (e.g. "Connection refused — is RouterOS reachable at
  192.168.88.1?"). The banner dismisses automatically when the connection
  is restored. Distinct from the red Socket.IO reconnect banner which fires
  only when the browser loses its connection to the MikroDash server itself
  (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`, `src/index.js`)
- **Container no longer blocks on RouterOS availability** — the startup
  sequence previously called `waitUntilConnected(60000)` in an async IIFE,
  meaning the HTTP server started but collectors never ran if RouterOS was
  unreachable at boot. The startup is now event-driven: collectors start the
  moment the `connected` event fires (whether that is immediately or minutes
  later), and the container stays healthy the entire time. The `ros:status`
  event is broadcast to all connected browser clients on every connection
  state change so the UI always reflects reality (`src/index.js`)
- **Human-readable RouterOS error messages** — raw Node.js network errors
  (`ECONNREFUSED`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `ENOTFOUND`, `ECONNRESET`) and RouterOS
  errors (TLS certificate, authentication) are translated to clear
  actionable messages before being sent to the client (`src/index.js`)

### Tests

- **Added production resilience regression coverage** — new tests cover the
  self-hosted asset/CSP contract, readiness health semantics, forced shutdown
  timer unref behavior, RouterOS write timeout recovery, connection collector
  truncation metadata, and auth failure eviction (`test/production-resilience-regressions.test.js`,
  `test/smoke-fixes.test.js`)

## [0.5.0] — UI Fixes & Security Hardening

### Security

- **Closed `traffic:select` whitelist race** — `_normalizeIfName()` in
  `TrafficCollector` previously allowed `traffic:select` events through when
  `availableIfs` was empty (i.e. before `sendInitialState()` had completed),
  bypassing the interface whitelist entirely. The guard is now inverted: an
  empty whitelist is treated as "not ready" and the event is rejected with a
  console warning rather than passed to the RouterOS API
  (`src/collectors/traffic.js`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Log viewer entries now render on separate lines** — `buildLogHtml()`
  was returning bare `<span>` elements joined with `\n`. Inside a `<div>`
  container, `\n` is collapsed whitespace and produces no visual line break.
  Each entry is now wrapped in a `<div class="log-line">` block element so
  every router log entry occupies its own line. The `flushLogs()` join
  separator is also cleaned up from `'\n'` to `''`
  (`public/app.js`)
- **Notification bell icon now shown on page load** — `updateNotifBtn()` was
  only ever called after an async `Notification.requestPermission()` callback,
  leaving the hardcoded crossed-bell SVG from `index.html` in place for the
  entire session on browsers where permission had already been granted. A
  startup IIFE now reads `Notification.permission` synchronously and calls
  `updateNotifBtn()` immediately so the correct icon is rendered before the
  user sees the topbar (`public/app.js`)
- **SVG network diagram boxes now respect light mode** — `.nd-node`,
  `.nd-count`, `.nd-label`, `.nd-wan-ip`, `.nd-line`, and `.nd-router-bg`
  had hardcoded dark RGBA fill/stroke values with no light-mode override,
  causing the Wired, Wireless, and WAN boxes to remain dark when switching
  themes. Seven `html[data-theme="light"]` CSS rules now override all
  affected SVG classes with light-appropriate colours (`public/index.html`)

### Features

- **`interfaces:error` Socket.IO event** — when `fetchInterfaces()` fails
  during `sendInitialState()`, the server now emits `interfaces:error` with
  the reason string instead of silently resolving to an empty list via
  `Promise.allSettled()`. The client handles this event by showing an
  explicit "Interface list unavailable" placeholder in the interface dropdown
  and logging the reason to the browser console, replacing a silent empty
  dropdown with actionable feedback (`src/index.js`, `public/app.js`)

## [0.4.9] — Deep Code Review Hardening Pass

### Security

- **HMAC-based timing-safe credential comparison** — authentication now
  compares HMAC-SHA256 digests of fixed length via `crypto.timingSafeEqual`,
  eliminating the timing side-channel that leaked credential length through
  the old length-check fast path (`446f2d2`)
- **Dropped unconditional X-Forwarded-For trust** — `getClientIp()` no longer
  reads `X-Forwarded-For` by default, preventing attackers from spoofing their
  IP to bypass rate limiting (`446f2d2`)
- **Sanitized /healthz error strings** — error messages are now truncated to
  200 characters with stack traces stripped before being exposed in the health
  endpoint, preventing internal implementation details from leaking (`faba151`)

### Features

- **Opt-in `TRUSTED_PROXY` env var** — when set to a proxy IP (e.g.
  `127.0.0.1`), Express `trust proxy` is enabled and `req.ip` correctly
  resolves the real client address from `X-Forwarded-For`. Disabled by default
  for safe out-of-the-box behaviour (`8965a31`)
- **Incremental ping updates** — server now emits lightweight `ping:update`
  events with only the latest data point; full history is sent once via
  `ping:history` on client connect, reducing per-tick payload size (`acb8001`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Unified version strings** — `APP_VERSION` is now sourced from
  `package.json` in one place, fixing inconsistencies between the healthz
  endpoint and startup log messages (`157986e`)
- **Removed redundant dynamic require** — `geoip-lite` was being required
  twice (module-level and inside a function); consolidated to module-level
  only (`157986e`)
- **Fixed /api/localcc polling storm** — client-side code moved the
  `fetch('/api/localcc')` call from inside the `conn:update` handler (fired
  every 3 s) to a once-per-connect pattern (`4b9e862`)
- **Decoupled wanIface from process.env** — `DhcpNetworksCollector` now
  receives `wanIface` as a constructor parameter instead of reading
  `process.env.WAN_IFACE` directly, improving testability (`4b9e862`)
- **Pruned stale keys in firewall, VPN, and talkers prev-maps** — all three
  Maps grew unboundedly as rules/peers/devices were added and removed; each
  collector now tracks seen keys per tick and deletes stale entries
  (`010bb46`)
- **Error state consistency** — all 7 collectors now set `lastXxxErr = null`
  on success instead of `delete`, keeping the state object shape stable and
  matching the initial values in `index.js` (`6df3e92`)
- **Per-interface traffic error flag** — replaced the single boolean
  `_hadTrafficErr` with a per-interface `Set`, so an error on one interface
  no longer suppresses first-error logging on others (`6df3e92`)
- **Extracted PING_COUNT constant** — the magic number `3` used in both the
  RouterOS ping command and the loss-calculation fallback is now a named
  constant (`6df3e92`)
- **DOM-based log truncation** — replaced `innerHTML.split('\n')` with
  `childNodes` counting and `removeChild`, avoiding O(n) re-serialization
  of the log panel on every new log line (`faba151`)

### Performance

- **Single-pass connections loop** — merged three separate iterations over
  the connections array (src/dst counts, protocol counts, country/port counts)
  into one loop (`acb8001`)
- **ARP reverse index** — `arp.js` now maintains a `byMAC` Map updated
  atomically in `tick()`, making `getByMAC()` O(1) instead of O(n)
  (`acb8001`)

### Earlier Hardening (prior commits)

- Hardened dashboard runtime paths and general polish (`200c1d9`, `8ac0703`,
  `5009ac9`)
