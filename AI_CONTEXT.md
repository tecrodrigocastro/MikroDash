# AI_CONTEXT.md

This file gives AI coding assistants (Claude, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) immediate grounding in the MikroDash codebase. Read this before suggesting any changes.

## What MikroDash is

MikroDash is a **real-time MikroTik RouterOS v7 dashboard**. It connects directly to the RouterOS binary API over a persistent TCP connection, streams live network data to a browser via Socket.IO, and serves a static single-page UI over Express. There are no page refreshes, no polling from the browser, no external agents, and no build step.

**Target user:** Network operator/admin on a trusted LAN.  
**Not for:** Public internet exposure — there is no HTTPS termination or role-based access control built in.

## Hard constraints — do not violate these

| Constraint | Detail |
|---|---|
| No build step | Plain CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`) throughout. No TypeScript, Babel, Webpack, Vite, or any transpiler. |
| No new test frameworks | Tests use `node:test` + `node:assert/strict` only. No Jest, Mocha, Vitest, or other deps. |
| No CDN dependencies | All frontend assets are vendored under `public/vendor/`. Never add a `<script src="https://...">` tag. |
| No new runtime deps without approval | The dependency list in `package.json` is intentional and minimal. |
| Collector pattern must be followed | Every new data collector must implement the contract described below. |
| Streaming-first architecture | **Prefer streaming over polling wherever RouterOS supports it.** Two streaming mechanisms exist: (1) `/listen` streams — event-driven, fires only when data changes (e.g. `/ip/arp/listen`); (2) `=interval=N` on print commands — RouterOS pushes a full snapshot every N seconds over a persistent channel (e.g. `/system/resource/print =interval=2`). Use `=interval=N` for any command that lacks a `/listen` variant but produces regular data (system resources, traffic counters, ping RTT, connection table). Polling via `setInterval` is a last resort only when neither mechanism is viable. When converting a collector to streaming, set `pollMs: 0` in the payload and show "Event-driven" in the Settings UI instead of a slider. |
| Credentials never in plaintext | Router and dashboard passwords are AES-256-GCM encrypted in `settings.json` and masked in all API responses. |
| Vendored assets are read-only | Never modify `public/vendor/` unless explicitly instructed. |

## Versioning & changelog rules

### When to bump the version

**Do not bump the version or update CHANGELOG.md or README.md during a working session.**

Version bumps, changelog entries, and README updates happen **only at the explicit end of a session**, when the user says something like "package it up", "we're done", "final zip", or otherwise signals they are satisfied with all changes made during the session. Until that instruction is given:

- Keep `package.json` version unchanged.
- Do not add entries to `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Do not modify `README.md`.

When the user does request final packaging, **one version bump covers the entire session** — all changes made since the previous release go into a single changelog entry. Never create one entry per fix or per sub-session.

### Semantic versioning

`major.minor.patch` in `package.json`. Bump patch for bug fixes; minor for new features or behaviour changes; major for breaking changes.

### How to write a CHANGELOG.md entry

1. Add the new version block at the **very top** of `CHANGELOG.md`, immediately after the file header line (`All notable changes…`).
2. Use this exact format:
   ```
   ## [x.y.z] — Short title describing the release

   ### Added
   - High-level user-facing feature descriptions only.

   ### Changed
   - Behaviour changes, architecture shifts, removed UI elements.

   ### Fixed
   - User-observable bugs, not internal refactors.
   ```
3. **Do not edit any previous version block.** The entry for the version being released is the only thing that changes.
4. **One entry per meaningful change** — no sub-bullets for implementation details, test names, or trial-and-error intermediate steps. If a bug was fixed through multiple iterations, write one bullet describing the final fix and its user-visible impact.
5. **Omit:** test additions, internal refactors with no user-visible effect, intermediate debugging steps, lint fixes, comment updates.
6. **Do not duplicate** a fix across multiple bullets. If a bug had multiple contributing causes, describe the root cause and fix once.

### How to update `package.json`

Change only the `"version"` field. Nothing else.

## Collector delivery model

| Collector | Delivery | RouterOS endpoint(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `traffic.js` | **Stream** (interval=1 s) | `/interface/monitor-traffic` | One persistent channel per subscribed interface; idle-gated |
| `system.js` | **Stream** (interval=N s) | `/system/resource/print` | Resource stream pushes every pollMs; `/system/health/print` polled separately at 2× interval (no interval= support); update-check every 12 h |
| `connections.js` | **Stream** (interval=N s) | `/ip/firewall/connection/print` | Initial `/print` on connect; interval stream replaces polling; watchdog restarts stale streams; idle-gated; skips geo computation when `page-connections` room is empty |
| `bandwidth.js` | Poll | `/ip/firewall/connection/print` | Shares `connTableCache` with connections; idle-gated |
| `talkers.js` | **Stream** (interval=N s) | `/ip/kid-control/device/print` | Backs off when Kid Control unavailable; idle-gated |
| `dhcpLeases.js` | **Stream** | `/ip/dhcp-server/lease/listen` | Initial `/print` on connect |
| `dhcpNetworks.js` | Poll | `/ip/dhcp-server/network/print` | Slow poll (default 10 min) |
| `arp.js` | **Stream** | `/ip/arp/listen` | Initial `/print` on connect |
| `wireless.js` | Poll | `/interface/wifi/registration-table/print` | Probes both wifi and legacy wireless APIs |
| `vpn.js` | **Stream** + Poll | `/interface/wireguard/peers/listen` | Stream for peer state; poll for counter snapshots; heartbeat every 60 s |
| `firewall.js` | **Stream** + Poll | `/ip/firewall/{filter,nat,mangle}/listen` | Three concurrent streams for rule state; poll for delta packet/byte counts; heartbeat every 60 s |
| `interfaceStatus.js` | **Stream** (interval=N s, ×3) | `/interface/print`, `/ip/address/print`, `/interface/monitor-traffic` | Three concurrent interval streams: interface state, IP addresses, byte counters; idle-gated |
| `ping.js` | **Stream** (interval=N s) | `/tool/ping` | Persistent interval stream replaces per-tick write(); ring-buffer history |
| `routing.js` | **Stream** | `/ip/route/listen` + `/routing/bgp/session/listen` | BGP keepalives fingerprint-suppressed |
| `logs.js` | **Stream** | `/log/listen` | Bounded history buffer (500 entries) |

**Rule:** always prefer streaming. Use `/listen` for event-driven data; use `=interval=N` on print commands that lack a `/listen` variant. Fall back to `setInterval` polling only when the RouterOS command genuinely cannot push (rare — check both mechanisms first).

## Known RouterOS API quirks

### `/ip/route/print` — `.flags` omitted for default-state routes

RouterOS v7 on some firmware builds omits the `.flags` field for routes in their default (active) state, treating active+static as unremarkable. Disabled routes always receive `.flags` because disabled is non-default. When writing route-related code, always include a fallback type-inference path: if no type flag is set and the gateway is a real IP address (matches an IPv4/IPv6 pattern, not an interface name like `'bridge'`), infer `static=true`. `/ip/route/listen` stream events always carry the full row so this only affects the initial `/print` load.

### `=.proplist=` on registration-table calls — can filter rows

On RouterOS v7 new wifi package, including unknown or absent field names in `=.proplist=` for `/interface/wifi/registration-table/print` can cause RouterOS to **filter rows** rather than simply omitting those fields per row. For example, requesting `'signal'` (which is `'signal-strength'` in the new API) may return only clients where that field is non-empty — resulting in only 1 of N clients being returned. **Do not use `=.proplist=` on wireless registration-table calls.** The table is small enough that the optimisation is not worth the risk.

### `!empty` reply — RouterOS 7.18+

RouterOS 7.18+ sends `!empty` when a command returns zero results. The `node-routeros` library throws `UNKNOWNREPLY` on this. `patch-routeros.js` patches `Channel.js` to treat `!empty` as an empty done (resolves to `[]`). This patch must be applied once after every `npm install` — the `Dockerfile` runs it automatically.

### UNREGISTEREDTAG crash — node-routeros

When RouterOS sends a packet for a tag that `node-routeros` has already cleaned up (trailing packet after `!done`, or delayed response after a stream is stopped), the library throws `UNREGISTEREDTAG` synchronously inside a socket data event — uncatchable by user code. `patch-routeros.js` patches `Receiver.js` to log and discard these packets instead.

---

## Collector pattern

**Streaming-first:** always prefer a `/listen` stream over a poll interval when the RouterOS endpoint supports it. See the constraint table above. Use the polling pattern only when no stream is available.

### Streaming collector pattern (preferred)

```js
class XyzCollector {
  constructor({ ros, io, pollMs, state }) {
    this.ros         = ros;
    this.io          = io;
    this.pollMs      = pollMs;   // retained for Settings UI / stale-threshold display only
    this.state       = state;
    this.timer       = null;     // null for fully-streamed collectors
    this.lastPayload = null;

    this._stream       = null;
    this._restarting   = false;
    this._restartTimer = null;
    this._heartbeat    = null;   // 60s re-emit so client stale timer never fires on stable networks
  }

  async start() {
    await this._loadInitial();   // one-shot /print to populate in-memory state
    this._startStream();
    this._startHeartbeat();

    // Register reconnect handlers EXACTLY ONCE — never call start() inside 'connected'.
    // Calling start() recursively doubles the listener count on every reconnect.
    this.ros.on('close', () => { this._stopStream(); this._stopHeartbeat(); });
    this.ros.on('connected', async () => {
      this._stopStream(); this._stopHeartbeat();
      await this._loadInitial();
      this._startStream(); this._startHeartbeat();
    });
  }

  _startStream() {
    if (this._stream || !this.ros.connected) return;
    this._stream = this.ros.stream(['/xyz/listen'], (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        this.state.lastXyzErr = String(err && err.message ? err.message : err);
        this._stopStream();
        if (this.ros.connected && !this._restarting) {
          this._restarting = true;
          this._restartTimer = setTimeout(async () => {
            this._restarting = false; this._restartTimer = null;
            if (!this.ros.connected) return;
            await this._loadInitial(); this._startStream();
          }, 3000);
        }
        return;
      }
      if (data) { this._applyDelta(data); this._emit(); }
    });
  }

  _stopStream() {
    if (this._restartTimer) { clearTimeout(this._restartTimer); this._restartTimer = null; }
    this._restarting = false;
    if (this._stream) { try { this._stream.stop(); } catch (_) {} this._stream = null; }
  }

  _startHeartbeat() {
    if (this._heartbeat) return;
    this._heartbeat = setInterval(() => {
      if (this.lastPayload) this.io.emit('xyz:update', { ...this.lastPayload, ts: Date.now() });
    }, 60000);
  }
  _stopHeartbeat() {
    if (this._heartbeat) { clearInterval(this._heartbeat); this._heartbeat = null; }
  }

  stop() {
    // Kept for settings live-update loop compatibility. Streaming collectors have
    // no poll timer — this is a safe no-op but must not throw.
    if (this.timer) { clearInterval(this.timer); this.timer = null; }
  }
}
```

**Streaming payload convention:** set `pollMs: 0` so the client knows data is event-driven. The Settings UI shows "Event-driven" instead of a slider.

### `=interval=N` streaming pattern (for commands without a `/listen` variant)

Many RouterOS print commands accept `=interval=N` to turn a one-shot response into a continuous push stream. RouterOS sends a fresh snapshot every N seconds over the same open channel. Use `ros.stream()` with a `null` callback and subscribe to the `'data'` event on the returned `RStream` — this bypasses the built-in `onStream()` handler which debounces section frames:

```js
_startStream() {
  const intervalSec = Math.max(1, Math.round(this.pollMs / 1000));
  const stream = this.ros.stream(
    ['/some/print', `=interval=${intervalSec}`, '=.proplist=field1,field2'],
    null  // null callback — use 'data' event instead
  );
  stream.on('data', (packet) => {
    // RouterOS interval responses include a .section field on the first packet
    // of each push cycle. Filter it: require at least one real data field.
    if (!packet || !packet['field1']) return;
    this._processRow(packet);
    this._emit();
  });
  stream.on('error', (err) => {
    this._stopStream();
    // restart after 3 s if still connected
    if (this.ros.connected && !this._restarting) {
      this._restarting = true;
      this._restartTimer = setTimeout(() => {
        this._restarting = false; this._restartTimer = null;
        if (this.ros.connected) this._startStream();
      }, 3000);
    }
  });
  this._stream = stream;
}
```

Key differences from `/listen` streams:
- RouterOS pushes data at a fixed interval regardless of whether values changed — fingerprint-check before emitting to avoid redundant Socket.IO frames.
- The interval is derived from `pollMs` (e.g. `pollMs: 5000` → `=interval=5`). Minimum 1 s.
- `pollMs` is still passed through to the client payload for the Settings UI slider — it controls the stream interval, not a JS timer.
- For commands that report byte/bit counters (traffic, interfaceStatus bandwidth), values are cumulative or rate-computed by RouterOS — no manual delta calculation needed.

### Polling collector pattern (only when no stream mechanism works)

```js
class XyzCollector {
  constructor({ ros, io, pollMs, state }) {
    this.ros = ros; this.io = io; this.pollMs = pollMs;
    this.state = state; this.timer = null; this._inflight = false;
    this.lastPayload = null;
  }

  async start() {
    const run = async () => {
      if (this._inflight) return;
      this._inflight = true;
      try { await this.tick(); } catch (e) {
        this.state.lastXyzErr = String(e && e.message ? e.message : e);
      } finally { this._inflight = false; }
    };
    run();
    this.timer = setInterval(run, this.pollMs);
    // Register handlers ONCE — never call start() inside 'connected'
    this.ros.on('close',     () => { if (this.timer) { clearInterval(this.timer); this.timer = null; } });
    this.ros.on('connected', () => { this.timer = this.timer || setInterval(run, this.pollMs); run(); });
  }

  async tick() {
    if (!this.ros.connected) return;
    const rows = await this.ros.write('/some/command');
    const payload = /* transform */;
    this.io.emit('xyz:update', payload);
    this.lastPayload = payload;
    this.state.lastXyzTs = Date.now(); this.state.lastXyzErr = null;
  }

  stop() { if (this.timer) { clearInterval(this.timer); this.timer = null; } }
}
module.exports = XyzCollector;
```

**Invariants (both patterns):**
- `lastPayload` is never null after first successful emit. `sendInitialState()` replays it to new browser clients.
- `state.last<n>Ts` and `state.last<n>Err` updated on every emit — feed `/healthz`.
- Stream-based collectors must restart after callback errors — transient failures must not leave the dashboard silently stale.
- All collector timers are cleared in `shutdown()` in `index.js`. New collectors must be added to `allCollectors` there.
- **Never call `start()` inside a `ros.on('connected')` handler.** Register `connected` and `close` listeners exactly once in `start()`. Calling `start()` recursively doubles the listener count on every reconnect, causing exponential listener growth and multiple concurrent collector chains.

## Socket.IO events

| Direction | Pattern | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Server → all clients (broadcast) | `<domain>:update` | `traffic:update`, `system:update`, `vpn:update` |
| Server → new client (initial state) | `<domain>:list` or `<domain>:history` | `leases:list`, `ping:history`, `logs:history` |
| Server → client (status / error) | `<domain>:status` or `<domain>:error` | `ros:status`, `interfaces:error`, `wan:status` |
| Client → server | `<domain>:<verb>` | `traffic:select` |
| Settings change broadcast | `settings:pages` | emitted to all clients on every settings save |
| Router list update | `routers:update` | emitted when routers.json changes (add/edit/delete/label update) |
| Active router changed | `router:active` | `{ activeId }` — emitted on hot-swap completion and to new sockets |
| Hot-swap in progress | `router:switching` | `{ routerId, label }` — emitted at start of hot-swap so UI can show overlay |

---

## REST endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/healthz` | none | Readiness probe. Returns `{ ok, version, routerConnected, startupReady, uptime, checks }` |
| `GET` | `/api/settings` | Basic Auth | Returns current settings with credentials masked as `••••••••` |
| `POST` | `/api/settings` | Basic Auth | Updates settings (poll intervals, page visibility, dashboard auth). Applies poll changes live. Broadcasts `settings:pages`. Router connection fields are managed via `/api/routers` instead. |
| `GET` | `/api/routers` | Basic Auth | List all routers, passwords masked. Returns `{ routers, activeId }` |
| `POST` | `/api/routers` | Basic Auth | Add a router. Returns saved entry (password masked) |
| `PUT` | `/api/routers/:id` | Basic Auth | Edit a router. Returns updated entry |
| `DELETE` | `/api/routers/:id` | Basic Auth | Delete a router. 409 if it is the active router |
| `POST` | `/api/routers/:id/activate` | Basic Auth | Hot-swap to router — tears down current session, builds new one in-process |
| `POST` | `/api/routers/test` | Basic Auth | Test a connection without saving. Returns `{ ok, boardName }` |
| `GET` | `/api/localcc` | Basic Auth | Returns `{ cc, wanIp }` — country code for WAN IP via geoip-lite |
| `GET` | `/api/routers` | Basic Auth | List all routers with passwords masked. Returns `{ routers, activeId }` |
| `POST` | `/api/routers` | Basic Auth | Add a router. Body: `{ host, port, tls, tlsInsecure, username, password, defaultIf, pingTarget, label }` |
| `PUT` | `/api/routers/:id` | Basic Auth | Edit a router. Same body as POST; password ignored if `'••••••••'` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/routers/:id` | Basic Auth | Delete a router. Returns `409` if target is the active router |
| `POST` | `/api/routers/:id/activate` | Basic Auth | Hot-swap to a different router. Responds immediately; swap runs async |
| `POST` | `/api/routers/test` | Basic Auth | Test a connection without saving. Returns `{ ok, boardName?, error? }` |

---

## Settings system

- Router list stored at `${DATA_DIR}/routers.json` (default: `/data/routers.json`) — managed by `src/routers.js`
- `settings.json` stored at `${DATA_DIR}/settings.json` (default: `/data/settings.json`)
- `routers.json` stored at `${DATA_DIR}/routers.json` — router list. `activeRouterId` in `settings.json` points to the active entry
- Credentials (`routerPass`, `dashPass`) are AES-256-GCM encrypted using a key derived from `DATA_SECRET`
- `settings.load()` merges stored values over `DEFAULTS`, decrypting credentials
- `settings.getPublic()` returns settings safe for the browser — credentials replaced with `••••••••`
- `settings.isMasked(v)` returns true if the value is the mask sentinel — used to ignore unchanged password fields in POST body
- `settings.save(updates)` merges updates, re-encrypts, writes to disk, updates in-memory cache
- Most settings changes take effect immediately without restart. Router connection changes (`routerHost`, `routerPort`, `routerTls`, `routerUser`, `routerPass`) require restart — the API returns `{ requiresRestart: true }`.

## Shared infrastructure in index.js

**`buildSession(routerCfg)`** — creates a fresh ROS instance + all 15 collectors + connTableCache wired to the given router config. Called on startup and on every hot-swap.

**`teardownSession(session)`** — stops all collectors (timers + streams), stops the ROS connection, waits 150 ms for in-flight callbacks to settle.

**`switchRouter(newRouterId)`** — hot-swap: broadcasts offline status, saves `activeRouterId`, calls teardownSession + buildSession, re-wires ROS events. Called by `POST /api/routers/:id/activate`.

**`connTableCache`** — shared cache for `/ip/firewall/connection/print` used by both `ConnectionsCollector` and `BandwidthCollector`. TTL = 40% of the faster collector's poll interval. Invalidated on ROS `close` event.

**`sendInitialState(socket)`** — called on every new Socket.IO connection. Replays `lastPayload` from every collector, sends traffic history, fetches interface list, sends current settings and page visibility.

**`broadcastRosStatus(connected, reason)`** — tracks last known ROS connection state and broadcasts `ros:status` to all clients. Converts raw Node.js error codes (`ECONNREFUSED`, `ETIMEDOUT`, etc.) into human-readable messages.

**`startCollectors()`** — called once on the first `connected` event from `ROS`. Starts all collectors in dependency order (leases before networks, before connections). Sets `startupReady = true` on success.

## Security model

### What is built (invariants — never weaken these)

- **LAN-only assumption.** No HTTPS termination. No role separation. Designed for trusted networks only.
- **Basic Auth** (optional): enabled when `BASIC_AUTH_USER` + `BASIC_AUTH_PASS` are set. Applied to all HTTP routes and the Socket.IO engine. Rate-limited to 100 req/min (skipped for `/healthz`).
- **CSP:** `helmetOptions.js` enforces a strict Content Security Policy allowing only self-hosted assets. No inline scripts beyond what already exists.
- **Error sanitization:** `sanitizeErr(e)` in `index.js` strips stack traces and truncates to 200 chars. Never send raw error objects to the browser.
- **Credential masking:** `settings.getPublic()` and `routers.getPublic()` ensure passwords are never returned in API responses. `isMasked()` prevents the mask sentinel `••••••••` from being written back as a real password value.
- **AES-256-GCM encryption at rest:** All router passwords and the dashboard password are encrypted in `settings.json` and `routers.json` using a key derived from `DATA_SECRET`. The plaintext value never touches disk.
- **Socket cap:** `MAX_SOCKETS` (default 50) — excess connections are disconnected immediately.
- **`DATA_SECRET`:** Must be set to a strong random value in production. The insecure default is for local development only. Never allow this value to be changed via the Settings UI — it is the encryption key for all stored credentials.

### Security requirements for new development

Every change — new endpoint, new setting, new UI feature — must be evaluated against the following checklist before implementation. These are not optional.

#### New REST endpoints
- All new endpoints must require Basic Auth. The only exempt endpoint is `/healthz` (health probe). Never add a new exempt endpoint without explicit justification.
- Validate and sanitize all input before using it. For string fields: trim, enforce a maximum length (256 chars for general strings, 512 for passwords). For integer fields: parse with `parseInt`, validate against a `[min, max]` range, reject `NaN`. For boolean fields: compare strictly (`=== true || === 'true'`).
- Never return raw Node.js error objects, stack traces, or `e.message` directly in API responses. Use `String(e.message || e).slice(0, 200)`.
- For operations that modify state (POST/PUT/DELETE), emit the relevant Socket.IO event so all connected clients see the update — don't rely on clients polling.
- The `DELETE /api/routers/:id` endpoint demonstrates the correct pattern for a dangerous operation: check a precondition (not the active router), return a meaningful HTTP status code (409 Conflict) on violation, and broadcast the change.

#### Credentials and secrets
- Passwords from the client must always be checked with `Settings.isMasked()` / the `••••••••` sentinel before storing. If the value is the mask, leave the stored value unchanged.
- Never log credentials, even in debug mode. The ROS `debug: true` option logs raw API frames — this is controlled by `ROS_DEBUG=true` in `.env` which is opt-in and documented as verbose.
- Never add credential fields to `DEFAULTS` in `settings.js` with a non-empty default value. Empty string is the only safe default for a credential.
- Router credentials (`host`, `port`, `username`, `password`, `tls`, `defaultIf`, `pingTarget`) are managed exclusively through `routers.js` and `/api/routers`. They must never be added back to the Settings API or stored directly in `settings.json` beyond `activeRouterId`.

#### What belongs in `.env` vs Settings UI
This distinction is a security boundary, not just a UX choice:

| `.env` only | Settings UI (runtime-configurable) |
|---|---|
| `DATA_SECRET` — the encryption key | Poll intervals |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY` — Express proxy trust | Page visibility |
| `PORT` — TCP bind port | Top-N limits |
| `MAX_SOCKETS` — DoS protection | Dashboard auth credentials (username/password) |
| `ROS_DEBUG` — raw API logging | Traffic history window |
| `BASIC_AUTH_USER` / `BASIC_AUTH_PASS` | Ping target |
| `DATA_DIR` — volume mount path | Router connection details (via Routers card) |

`TRUSTED_PROXY` must remain `.env`-only. Allowing it to be set via the UI would let a misconfigured or malicious value cause Express to trust spoofed `X-Forwarded-For` headers, bypassing the rate limiter and potentially spoofing client IPs in auth decisions. Similarly, `DATA_SECRET` must never be exposed in the UI — changing it at runtime would invalidate all encrypted credentials on disk.

#### Frontend / client-side
- All user-supplied strings rendered into HTML must be passed through `esc()` (the XSS-escaping helper defined at the top of `app.js`). No exceptions, even for data that looks numeric.
- Never construct HTML by concatenating unescaped user data. The correct pattern: `'<div>' + esc(userValue) + '</div>'`.
- Never write credentials, encryption keys, or `DATA_SECRET` into the DOM, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or any JavaScript global.
- Passwords sent to the server should be in the request body (POST/PUT), never in query parameters or URL paths.
- The mask sentinel `••••••••` must be rendered as a placeholder in password fields, not as an actual value the user would need to clear before typing.

#### Dependency additions
- No new runtime dependencies without explicit approval (existing hard constraint). This applies doubly to any dependency that processes untrusted input (parsers, templating engines, serialization libraries) — these are high-risk attack surface.
- Never add client-side JavaScript from a CDN. All frontend assets must be vendored under `public/vendor/`. A compromised CDN delivering a malicious script would have full access to the dashboard and all Socket.IO data.

#### Router API connections
- All RouterOS connections must go through the `ROS` class in `src/routeros/client.js`. Never open a raw TCP connection to a router from elsewhere in the codebase.
- The `test` connection endpoint (`POST /api/routers/test`) creates a temporary ROS instance. It must always call `testRos.stop()` in all code paths — including errors and timeouts — to prevent connection leaks.
- `tlsInsecure: true` disables certificate verification. This is a user-acknowledged risk for self-signed certs on private networks. It must never be set to `true` programmatically without the user's explicit opt-in.

## Testing conventions

**Runner:** `node --test` · **Command:** `npm test` · **No extra test deps**

### Fake object shapes (copy-paste ready)

```js
// Fake ROS — polling collector
const ros = { connected: true, on() {}, write: async () => [/* rows */] };

// Fake ROS — streaming collector
let streamHandler;
const ros = {
  connected: true, on() {},
  stream(words, cb) { streamHandler = cb; return { stop() {} }; },
};

// Fake IO
const emitted = [];
const io = { emit(ev, data) { emitted.push({ ev, data }); } };

// Deterministic timing
const orig = Date.now;
Date.now = () => fixedNow;
try { await collector.tick(); } finally { Date.now = orig; }
```

### Coverage checklist for new collectors/features

- [ ] Happy path → correct payload shape and values
- [ ] Empty/null RouterOS response → no crash, sensible defaults (0, null, [])
- [ ] Malformed field values → clamped to 0 or fallback, not NaN/undefined
- [ ] `state.last<n>Ts` updated on success; `state.last<n>Err` set on failure
- [ ] Rate-based: counter reset → 0 rate (never negative); stale `prev` entries pruned
- [ ] Stream-based: callback error → stream restarts, existing state preserved
- [ ] Inflight guard: second tick skipped while first is in progress
- [ ] `stop()`: timer cleared correctly

## Run instructions

```bash
# First time (or after npm install)
node patch-routeros.js

# Development
npm install
npm test
node src/index.js

# Production
docker compose up -d --build
```

The app starts and serves the UI immediately. Collectors start only after the first successful RouterOS connection. The browser shows a connection banner until RouterOS is reachable — this is expected behaviour, not a bug.
